# Android_weightTracker
The application I developed is a mobile weight-tracking journal. The main goal of the app was to allow the user to enter their daily weight into a data table that displays their information allowing for easy comparisons. This replaces the need to carry around a pen and paper while introducing greater functionality as well.
